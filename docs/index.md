## Teaching

### EE192 (Mechatronics Design Lab), UC Berkeley
**[Spring 2020](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~ee192/sp20/)**, co-Graduate Student Instructor \\
**[Spring 2015](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~ee192/sp15/)**, Graduate Student Instructor (Outstanding GSI Award)

EE192 is an undergraduate design project class, where students build a line-following ~1:10 scale race car.
Students start from a stock chassis with motor and servo, and design and assemble custom circuit boards for power conversion and logic, and write the firmware including controls loops (typically PID).
Students work in groups of three, and the semester-long interdisciplinary project involves hands-on, practical mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and computer science.

In 2015, my focus was on developing a [re-usable slide deck for discussion / lab sections](https://github.com/ucb-ee192/course-site) and on writing a [live telemetry visualization system](https://github.com/ucb-ee192/telemetry) to encourage students to work with data instead of debugging by trial-and-error ü§¶‚Äç.

In 2020 and along with co-GSI Derek Chou, we focused on refactoring the course to get students to a working car as soon as possible by providing the first iteration electronics as a circuit board kit.
We hoped a reference circuit board would help demonstrate the implicit knowledge of what makes good circuit boards, while going through the assembly process would help students consider design-for-manufacturing (DFM) when they build their own.
While we didn't know it at the beginning of the semester, this turned out to be invaluable for the pandemic: all students had working cars and controls by the time the lockdown hit, and we consider this an extremely lucky success.
For the rest of the semester, we shifted focus to controls and learning (track memorization) in simulation in V-REP.
