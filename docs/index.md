## About

I'm interested in improving electronics design, by making it more accessible and usable for novices, and more efficient for experts.
My primary research focuses on board-level design, emphasizing design re-use and abstraction, and blending techniques from the human-computer interaction (HCI), programming languages (PL), and electrical engineering (EE) domains.

Previously, I was a postdoc at UCLA, as part of Ankur Mehta's LEMUR lab, and before that I completed my PhD at UC Berkeley, co-advised by Bj√∂rn Hartmann and Elad Alon.

Check out my [research work](research.md) and the [circuit boards](boards.md) I've designed as part of the research project into a hardware description language for boards!
