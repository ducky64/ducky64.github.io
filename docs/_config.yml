# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,

# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  I'm interested in improving electronics design, by making it more accessible and usable for novices, and more efficient for experts.
  My primary research focuses on board-level design, emphasizing design re-use and abstraction, and blending techniques from the human-computer interaction (HCI), programming languages (PL), and electrical engineering (EE) domains.
  I also continue to work on chip- and FPGA-level digital logic design languages, similarly applying a blend of HCI and PL techniques to produce usable tools. <br/><br/>
  
  I am a postdoc at UCLA, as part of Ankur Mehta's LEMUR lab.
  Previously, I completed my PhD at UC Berkeley, co-advised by by Bj√∂rn Hartmann and Elad Alon.
